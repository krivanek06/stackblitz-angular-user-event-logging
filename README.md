## Description

Repo contains an idea to a simple logger that can track user behaviour. The tracking includes:

- DOM element clicks
- Input element value changes
- Dialog open and closing states
- Form submissions
- Navigation changes (internal / external)

To try out the logger, install the dependencies and launch the application.
As you interact with the form, logs are displayed in the console.
